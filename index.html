        <p>The human mind is vulnerable and negative, and one of the best remedies to prevent being prey to negative thoughts is a book. Books are an irreplaceable asset to humanity. Some even say that books are man’s best friend. No other human can do us as much good as a good book can.<br>Books provide us with knowledge about the physical aspects of the world and guide us through life. Without books, the advancement of our civilization would have been complicated. Books have given the answers to the most challenging questions time and again. Without them, many secrets of the universe would have been unknown. That is why; books are one of the significant components of leading a healthy and happy life. If everyone reads books, only then the cultural and mental development of people will be possible.</p>
